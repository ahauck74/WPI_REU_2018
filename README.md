# WPI_REU_2018

This Repo was used by me and another student for Worcester Polytechnic Institute's 2018 Data Science Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). The goal of the project was to reaserh and then build a machine learning model that could make more accurate predictions for multivariate time series data sets with high proportions of missing values. The code we wrote was used to run a series of tests to compare our model against various other proposed models we found in our research by comparing their predictive accuracies across multiple datasets.
